\textbf{An overview of dataset}

\textbf{What does it include?}
My dataset include match detail for e-sport game 'league of legends' 

refrence URL: https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#match-v5/GET_getMatch
most data under ParticipantDto block will be my dataset.
https://na.whatismymmr.com/
This gives me a numeric value how well each player is 

\textbf{Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source.}

I write a python script to directly collect my data from riot developer portal  but it  only allow 100 request for every 2 minutes, therefore my data collection is not done yet when I write this memo, it should be done in the following week.

riot_api.py is the script I wrote to collect my data it is in this repo.


\textbf{About how many observations? How many predictors?}
There are 6 tiers will be in my dataset, they are 'Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond'
Each tiers has about 4000 observation and each observation has about 50 perdictors.


\textbf{What types of variables will you be working with?}
Most of my variables will be numeric. There are few categorical variables.


\textbf{Is there any missing data? About how much? Do you have an idea for how to handle it?}
Since I am the person collecting my data, and it is directly from riot there is no missing data.



\textbf{An overview of research question(s)}

\textbf{What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What question(s) are you interested in answering?}

I am interested in how to make a prediction on player's mmr (Match Making Rating) based on a game play from some random player. 
MMR is determined by the rank you are in. I think the match up data is different in each skill level and I am trying to make a prediction on it.
Few question that I have now:
Will more kill/death rate brings you a higher rank?
How much vision score effect your MMR?
Is there a huge difference on champExperience between low tier players and high tier players.

\textbf{Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe it/them.}

MMR (Match Making Rating) will be my outcome.  MMR is a number used by League of Legends to represent a playerâ€™s skill level. 

\textbf{Will these questions be best answered with a classification or regression approach?}
Most of my question will be best answerd in regression approach.


\textbf{Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?}
The following predictors I believe will be most useful:
deaths, deaths, assists, champExperience, champLevel, damageDealtToBuildings, longestTimeSpentLiving, wardsPlaced, wardsKilled,visionScore 

\textbf{Is the goal of your model descriptive, predictive, inferential, or a combination? Explain.}
predictive, I am going to predict a numeric value based on my predicotrs.


\textbf{Your proposed project timeline}

week 3-4: Load and tidy data
week 5: Run and write up descriptive analyses
week 6-7: Run and adjust models
week 8: write results
week 9: Work on draft of paper
week 10: edit paper
